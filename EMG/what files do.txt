constants.py
    Purpose: Defines constant values used across the project, including screen dimensions, frame rate, test duration, and logging interval.
    Variables:
        - WIDTH: Screen width (960).
        - HEIGHT: Screen height (640).
        - FPS: Frames per second (60).
        - TEST_DURATION: Duration of the test in seconds (3).
        - LOGGING_INTERVAL: Interval for logging data (0.01 seconds).

emg.py
    Purpose: Handles the connection to an Arduino via serial port to read EMG data. It runs a background thread to continuously read and parse incoming data lines into filtered and envelope values.
    Classes:
        - EMGReader: Manages the serial connection and data reading.
    Functions:
        - __init__(port="COM6", baud=115200): Initializes the serial connection and starts the reading loop.
        - _loop(): Continuously reads lines from the serial port, parses 'filtered' and 'envelope' values, and updates the class attributes.
        - stop(): Stops the reading loop and closes the serial connection.

feature_engineering.py
    Purpose: Feature engineering script that reads 'emg_streamed_cleaned.csv', parses the 'filtered_values', chunks them into 50-value segments, and calculates various time-domain and frequency-domain features (WL, AAC, DASDV, AR, CC). It assigns an output label based on 'level_number' and saves the extracted features to 'emg_features.csv'.
    Functions:
        - calculate_emg_features(signal, ar_order=4): Takes an EMG signal segment and an autoregressive order as input. Calculates Waveform Length (WL), Average Amplitude Change (AAC), Difference Absolute Standard Deviation Value (DASDV), Auto-regressive Coefficients (AR), and Cepstral Coefficients (CC). Returns a dictionary containing these features.

livestream.py
    Purpose: Simulates or performs real-time processing of EMG data streams. It uses a trained model to make predictions on a live data stream by buffering incoming values and calculating features on the fly.
    Functions:
        - process_livestream(data_stream): Consumes a data stream, maintains a rolling buffer of 50 values, calculates features for each full buffer, and uses the loaded 'bg_model.h5' to predict the output.
        - main execution: Sets up an EMGReader, a Logger, and runs the process_livestream function using a live stream generator.

logger.py
    Purpose: Handles data logging functionality. It supports logging session metadata to 'info.csv' and high-frequency streaming data to 'emg_stream.csv'. It includes a threaded worker for background logging and a generator for live streaming.
    Classes:
        - Logger: Manages file paths and logging operations.
    Functions:
        - ensure_log_header(): Creates 'info.csv' with the appropriate headers if it doesn't exist.
        - log_level_result(session_id, name, age, ...): Appends a new row of session results to 'info.csv'.
        - _stream_worker(...): Background thread function that logs high-frequency data to 'emg_stream.csv' in chunks.
        - start_stream(session_id, level_number, get_value_callable): Starts the background logging thread.
        - stop_stream(): Stops the background logging thread.
        - live_stream_generator(session_id, level_number, ...): A generator that yields values for real-time processing while simultaneously logging them to 'emg_stream.csv'.

model.py
    Purpose: Defines, trains, evaluates, and saves a neural network model for EMG signal classification. It handles data loading, splitting, model construction (Sequential NN), and predicting.
    Functions:
        - load_and_preprocess_data(filepath='emg_features.csv'): Loads feature data, parses array columns (AR, CC), extracts scalar features (WL, AAC, DASDV), and returns the feature matrix X and target vector y.
        - split_data(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=13): Splits the data into training and testing sets.
        - build_model(input_dim=INPUT_DIM, verbose=False): Constructs and compiles a Sequential neural network with two hidden layers and one output layer.
        - train_neural_network(model, X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size=32): Trains the model with early stopping.
        - predict(model, X): Makes a binary prediction (True/False) for a single input based on a 0.5 threshold.
        - evaluate_model(model, X_test, y_test): Evaluates the model on the test set and returns accuracy.
        - save_model_to_disk(model, filepath='bg_model.h5'): Saves the trained model to a file.
        - load_and_predict(model_path, input_data): Loads a saved model and makes a prediction on new input data.
